# The data in air.csv relate to airline cancellations and delays for the year 2008.
# You can download the air.csv dataset from
# http://rtricks4kids.ok.ubc.ca/wjbraun/DS550/air.csv.
# It is too large to fit on the regular github repository.
# In order to read the data from air.csv into R, you will need to type

#air <- read.csv("air.csv")
#summary(air)
#head(air)


# airorts.R and FightBehaviour.R are derived from air.csv which include record of over 7 million flights.

source("airports.R")
summary(airports)

# Data in cancellations give the coordinates of originating and terminating airports of
# flights taking place in the U.S. For each connection, the number of flights has been calculated (Number),
#as well as the corresponding numbers (and proportions) of cancelled
# and diverted flights
source("cancellations.R")
summary(cancellations)


# FlightBehaviour contains similar kinds of counts, but broken down by airline carrier
# (Carrier). It also includes ArrDelay which gives information summarizing the number
# of flights that were delayed by more than 5 minutes.
source("FlightBehaviour.R")
summary(FlightBehaviour)


# cancellations shiny app is a shiny app which provide data visualization on cancellations.R
# It contains two cut-off levels for arrivals and cancellation.

# Here is a shiny app for arrivals data visualization

# mapPlot is a shiny app to explore proportional flight delays.
# This app provides two cut-off slider bars for proportional delay and number of arrivals

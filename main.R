# The data in air.csv relate to airline cancellations and delays for the year 2008.
# You can download the air.csv dataset from
# http://rtricks4kids.ok.ubc.ca/wjbraun/DS550/air.csv.
# It is too large to fit on the regular github repository.
# In order to read the data from air.csv into R, you will need to type

#air <- read.csv("air.csv")
#summary(air)
#head(air)


# airorts.R and FightBehaviour.R are derived from air.csv which include record of over 7 million flights.
